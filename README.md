# Relevant Leetcode
A website that shows the most frequently asked questions by companies. 

Check it out: https://nikhilm25.github.io/RelevantLeetcode/

All data is present in questions_data.json.

Unfortunately I lack the money to afford leetcode premium anymore and will not be able to continue updating this list. Honestly there arent many changes per update so it doesnt really affect much, the questions are the same, its about the hardwork you put in.

I have added in a python script that converts the normal csvs format to questions_date.json format. Using it on a repo like https://github.com/snehasishroy/leetcode-companywise-interview-questions would work with some minor tweaks. This way the data can be updated from different repos that match the format of the one linked. Feel free to open  a pull request to add in updated data.
